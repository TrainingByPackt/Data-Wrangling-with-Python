      "Archie vs. Predator is a comic book series written by Alex de Campi (pictured) of Dark Horse Comics and drawn by Fernando Ruiz of Archie Comics. It features Predator, a deadly alien trophy hunter, who stalks the clean-cut teenager Archie Andrews and his high school classmates, until the survivors realize they are being hunted and fight back. A four-issue limited series was released in the US in 2015 between April and July, and a hardcover collection went on sale in November. Archie Comics proposed the idea to Dark Horse, which holds the license to comics featuring 20th Century Fox's Predator. The series received positive reviews from critics, who enjoyed the strange matchup and dark humor. The April issue was the top seller for both publishers, and garnered an average review rating of 7.9 out of 10 according to the review aggregator Comic Book Roundup. The series won a Ghastly Award for Best Limited Series. (Full article...)\n",
